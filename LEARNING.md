## Steps

1. Managed to get straight lines in between points
2. Got curved lines in between them
3. Time to make them dinamic

	Fail, because it is only taking into account the complete axels, I'm goint to split them in radii
4. Spiderweb between radii!
5. Let's make radii dynamic (this will allow for variance)
6. Parametrizing stuff to add randomness
7. [WIP] Move points up and down a bit!!

- Add manual controls
- Writeup

## Learnt

- How to create a FAST generative playing sandbox
- How Spider webs are constructed
- How paths work
- How to obtain the midpoint between two points
- How to create a new point offset an specific amount in the bisecting angle between two points
